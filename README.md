# Weather-Dashboard
A weather application that shows the forecast for the selected city.

## Description 
- A simple weather dashboard that provides weather forecasts for the current day and the next 5 days. The forecast will include Temperature, Wind speed, Humidity, cloud cover, and an icon representation of the forecasted weather. This challenge focused on the use of the server-side Web Apis. This challenge has helped me practice my jQuery and Bootstrap skills, along side Javascript and HTML.

## User Story
- AS A traveler
- I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Usage
- Click the search box to enter a city name. If it is a valid city the forecast for that city will appear. If the name you entered is not a valid city you will be alerted to try again. Every city searched will be saved as buttons that can later be used to quickly get forecasts.
